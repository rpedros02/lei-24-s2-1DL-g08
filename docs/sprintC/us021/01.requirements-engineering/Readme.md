# US021 - Adding Entries for GSM. 


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a GSM, I want to add a new entry to the To-Do List.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the client clarifications:**

**From the specifications document:**

> The Agenda is a crucial mechanism for planning the weekâ€™s work. Each entry
in the Agenda defines a task (that was previously included in the to-do list).

>  The management of green areas for public use requires the timely management and completion of multiple tasks throughout the year. In the daily
management, the GSM uses two essential tools: the Agenda and the Task
List (aka To-Do List). The To-Do List comprises all the tasks required to
be done in order to assure the proper functioning of the parks.

> **Question:** What are the requests/ input data to list the vehicles needing the check-up?
> Type of vehicle, Current Km and Maintenance/Check-up Frequency (in Kms) are sufficient?
>
> **Answer:** Current Km and Maintenance/Check-up Frequency (in Kms) are sufficient, yes;

> **Question:** Are there acceptance criteria when asking for the list?

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The new entry must be associated with a green space managed by the GSM.
