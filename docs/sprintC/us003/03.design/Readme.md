### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

* Organization
* Task

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

* CreateTaskUI  
* CreateTaskController

_**Note that SSD - Alternative Two is adopted.**_

### Full Diagram

This diagram shows the full sequence of interactions between the classes involved in the realization of this user story.

### Split Diagrams

The following diagram shows the same sequence of interactions between the classes involved in the realization of this user story, but it is split in partial diagrams to better illustrate the interactions between the classes.

It uses Interaction Occurrence (a.k.a. Interaction Use).
